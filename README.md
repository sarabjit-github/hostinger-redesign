### I'm take a part in Thapa Codefest September 2022 and the task for Thapa Codefest September 2022 is to redesign Hostinger website.

According to Codefest rule I can't copy any online template, So first, I made a new Prototype of Hostinger website and then convert into High quality prototype. Here is the Link of my Figma file: https://www.figma.com/file/qOJURmCKKgP7SlYrKc2vBT/Hostinger_Redesign?node-id=0%3A1

So now my design was ready and I convert this Design into high quality code and Fully responsive upto 375px devices length.

### Technologies used:
  - **React**
  - **Framer Motion library for animations**
  - **Scss for styling**
  - **Figma for New Design**
